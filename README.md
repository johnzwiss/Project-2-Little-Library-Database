# Project-2-Little-Library-Database


The user will be presented with a homepage picturing a little library. The user will be prompted to login or signup with a username and password. The user will be then be shown an index of available books at that library. The user will be able to select a book by clicking on the image. This will take th user to a page showing more information about the book. Using the Google Books API, the user will be able to see a preview of the book. The user can then comment, like, mark as read, or "take out" the book. If a user takes out the book, it will be removed from the original index. The user will have the option to return the book when they are finished with the book. Users are also able to add books to the library themselves. 



I am planning to start with an index and option for ONE of the libraries in my neighborhood. My stretch goal would be to have a few of them with them displayed on a static map that the user is able to select from after the login page and before the index page.
